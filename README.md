## SQL Task Solutions

Detail-oriented professional with a passion for continuous learning and growth in data analytics. Proactive in identifying trends and opportunities, I approach challenges methodically with an analytical mindset, delivering clear, data-driven solutions that lead to meaningful outcomes.

This repository serves as a showcase of my SQL skills, where I tackle a variety of tasks designed to test and improve my data analysis abilities. Each task solution highlights my proficiency in SQL, demonstrating my ability to work with data efficiently and effectively.

## Task Descriptions
The SQL tasks solved in this repository include:
1. **Monthly Percentage Difference**: Calculating month-over-month percentage changes in revenue to identify business trends.
2. **New Products**: Analyzing the net difference in product launches year-over-year to understand market activity.
3. **Risky Projects**: Identifying projects that are at risk of going over budget to better manage resources and costs.

5. **Word Occurrences in Drafts**: Counting the frequency of words in text drafts to gain insights into text analysis.

Detailed solutions for these tasks can be found in the `Tasks.md` file, where each task is described in detail along with the SQL code used to solve it.

## Future Goals
- Continue expanding the repository with more SQL tasks to refine my skills in advanced query writing.
- Integrate data visualization techniques to present the results of complex SQL queries visually.
- Evolve this repository from a collection of task-based solutions into a comprehensive data analysis project.
